# Lia's Room

In this project I have built a single page type website which consists of three sections:

1."Welcome"- the content that is visible when the website loads.

2."Rooms"- the main content of the website.

3."Contact"- a Form to contact me.

The webpage has a navigation menu that allows navigation between the different sections as well as a "back to top" in the footer.

In addition, I have designed the webpage to be responsive and it can be viewed on multiple devices: PC, tablet or a smartphone.

When viewed on tablet or smartphone the navigation menu changes to a hamburger-icon.

All of the images seen on this webpage are original and were designed and created by me.
